Alura Challenge Back End: checking a household budge using API.

This application must allow a person to cadastre their receipts and expenditures of the month, as well as to manage a monthly relationship.

We developed:
- Router APIs implemented following the best practice of the REST model;
- Validations in accordance with business rules;
- Implementation of data base data;
- Authentication / authorization service to restrict access to information.
